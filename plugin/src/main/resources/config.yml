# A list of arenas to create when OpenMissileWars starts. You are free to create more arenas or
# delete the ones listed here at your leisure
arenas:
  - vanilla
  - enhanced
# Each arena has a separate config which is derived from the entries below. Each entry below must
# specify a regular expression which is used to determine whether it applies to an arena. For
# example, the "mw1" pattern would match just the mw1 arena, the "mw\d+" pattern would match all
# "mw<number>" arenas and the ".*" pattern matches every arena. Note that if two entries match
# the same arena name, the first one takes precedence. That said, if a property is not specified
# in the first matching entry, other matching entries can set it. If no matching entries set a
# property or if no entries match an arena, a default value will be used
configs:
  # Configuration for the enhanced version of the game built into OpenMissileWars. See the
  # entries below for documentation
  - pattern: enhanced
