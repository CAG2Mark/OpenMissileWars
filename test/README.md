# OpenMissileWars Automated End-to-end Test System

This directory contains an automated end-to-end testing system for OpenMissileWars.
It consists of a [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) bot which performs basic operations within the game to ensure it works at its core.
The testing server which is automatically run is bound to port 36676 to minimize the potential for conflict.
This testing system is designed to be run headlessly in a continuous integration environment.
